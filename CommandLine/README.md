### About this resource
Command line comes in many different flavors. To keep things simple they pretty much do the same type of things: "access and manipulate the system via a command line prompt".

### Notes:
At this time, i'm going to focus on the linux command line commands, I may throw some windows command prompts in as time goes on. I won't, at this time, be adding any unique to powershell commands in, and anything that isn't aforementioned on this resource.
